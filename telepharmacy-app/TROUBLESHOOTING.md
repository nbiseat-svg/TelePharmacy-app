# TelePharmacy Application - Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
- Frontend server: Running on http://localhost:5175
- Backend server: Running on http://localhost:5000
- API endpoint: /api/medications accessible
- Static files: Being served from public directory

## Diagnostic Steps Taken

### 1. Verified Server Status
✅ Frontend Vite server is running
✅ Backend Express server is running
✅ API endpoints are accessible

### 2. Tested API Connectivity
✅ Direct API call to http://localhost:5000/api/medications works
✅ Proxy configuration from frontend to backend is working
✅ JSON data is being returned correctly

### 3. Simplified Application Components
✅ Created minimal React components
✅ Removed complex dependencies (Redux, Framer Motion, etc.)
✅ Created simplified header and footer components
✅ Created basic CSS styling

### 4. Created Diagnostic Pages
✅ BasicTest page to verify React rendering
✅ ApiTest page to verify frontend-backend communication
✅ Static HTML page for direct API testing

## Possible Issues to Investigate

### 1. Browser Cache
Try clearing your browser cache or opening in an incognito/private window.

### 2. JavaScript Errors
Check the browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors that might be preventing the page from rendering.

### 3. CSS Issues
The application might be rendering but with CSS that makes it appear blank.

### 4. Routing Problems
There might be issues with React Router configuration.

### 5. Component Rendering
Individual components might have errors preventing them from rendering.

## How to Diagnose Further

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open the browser's developer tools (F12) and check:
- Console tab for JavaScript errors
- Network tab for failed requests
- Elements tab to see if HTML is being generated

### 2. Test Individual Components
Try accessing:
- http://localhost:5175/ (Main application)
- http://localhost:5175/api-test.html (Static HTML API test)
- http://localhost:5175/api-test (React API test page)

### 3. Verify API Access
Run this command in terminal to test API directly:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/medications
```

### 4. Check File Structure
Ensure all required files exist:
- src/SimpleApp.jsx
- src/components/SimpleHeader.jsx
- src/components/SimpleFooter.jsx
- src/pages/BasicTest.jsx
- src/pages/ApiTest.jsx
- public/api-test.html

## Commands for Testing

### Restart Servers
```bash
# Backend (from project root)
node telepharmacy-app/server/simple-server.js

# Frontend (from telepharmacy-app/frontend directory)
npx vite
```

### Test API Directly
```bash
# Test medications endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/medications

# Test users endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/users

# Test prescriptions endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/prescriptions
```

## Fallback Solutions

### 1. Use Static HTML Version
If React isn't working, the static HTML version in public/api-test.html should work.

### 2. Create Simple Vanilla JavaScript Version
A version without React dependencies could be created if needed.

### 3. Check Node.js Version Compatibility
Ensure Node.js version is compatible with all dependencies.
